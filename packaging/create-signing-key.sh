Done. Fingerprint: $fpr

Next:
  1. Move $backup to offline storage (it holds the private key and its
     revocation certificate) and keep the passphrase in your password manager.
  2. Review and commit the public key:
       git add packaging/signing-key.asc
       git commit -m "Publish the packaging key ($fpr)"
  3. Publish the fingerprint somewhere other than the repository (your
     profile, the project's website), so users can cross-check the key.
  4. Before it expires (in $KEY_EXPIRY), extend it from the backup, in a
     throwaway keyring:
       export GNUPGHOME=\$(mktemp -d)
       gpg --import private-key.asc
       gpg --quick-set-expire $fpr 3y
       gpg --armor --export $fpr > packaging/signing-key.asc
       gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $fpr | gh secret set GPG_PRIVATE_KEY
     then commit packaging/signing-key.asc and replace the backup.
